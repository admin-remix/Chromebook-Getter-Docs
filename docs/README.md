[Chromebook Getter](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chromebook-getter/iamajmlafjfaobppjfllijpikffekpok?authuser=0)
is a Google sheet add on that allows Gsuite super admin to get & set Chromebook meta data.
It was created as a replacement for the chromebookinventory add on that was depricated on July 15th 2019. The project is maintained by [AdminRemix](https://AdminRemix.com)

## How It Works

Chromebook Getter is powered by Google Appscript.
The add on runs localy in the users browser and communicates directly with Google servers.
This results in a smooth, streamlined app that keeps data privacy conerns at its core.

## Features

* [Get Chromebooks](/get-chromebooks/)
* [Set Chromebooks Meta Data](/set-chromebooks/)
* [Get All Chromebooks](/get-all-chromebooks/)

## Why Not...?

#### Build My Own Tool

Sure this can be done but we know any time spent doing this is time you could be doing other things,
like helping a teacher with an issue, installing that new phone system or maybe deploying Chromebooks.
Let us handle the work of fixing the weird bugs that come with building software on top of Google for you.
