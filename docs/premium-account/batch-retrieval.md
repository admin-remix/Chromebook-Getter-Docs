# Batch Retrieval Mode

## Overview

There are times when you want to pull a list of devices from a list that could be in multiple organizational units. Using the batch retrieval system you can now copy and paste or scan (using a hand scanner) in a list of asset tags or serial numbers and pull those devices down from the admin console.

## How To Use
