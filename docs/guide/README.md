# Introduction

![Chromebook Getter Logo](~@static/getterlogo.png)

[Chromebook Getter](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chromebook-getter/iamajmlafjfaobppjfllijpikffekpok?authuser=0)
is a Google sheet add on that allows Gsuite super admin to get & set Chromebook meta data.
It was created as a replacement for the chromebookinventory add on that was depricated on July 15th 2019. The project is maintained by [AdminRemix](https://AdminRemix.com)

## How It Works

Chromebook Getter is powered by Google Appscript.
The add on runs locally in the user's browser and communicates directly with Google servers.
This results in a smooth, streamlined app that keeps data privacy concerns at its core.

## Why Not...?

#### Build My Own Tool

Sure! This can be done. But we know any time spent doing this is time you could be more productive as in:
* helping teachers with their technology issues,
* installing new phone systems,
* or deploying Chromebooks

Let us handle the work for you. We solve the bugs and problems that come with building software on top of Google API's.
